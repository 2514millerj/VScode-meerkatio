# MeerkatIO Extension for Visual Studio Code

[MeerkatIO](https://meerkatio.com) is a personal notification tool for software developers with long-running scripts. The MeerkatIO Platform will help you save time and help you to stop watching your code run.

## Features

The MeerkatIO VS Code Extension supports the following notification channels:
- Ping
- Slack Direct Message
- SMS
- Email

## Quickstart

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Setup
No setup is required to use the Ping command with this extension, but in order to access Slack, SMS, and Email notification channels a MeerkatIO account is required. [Get started for free today!](https://meerkatio.com/register)

MeerkatIO notifications will automatically (after a window reload) execute for all tasks and debug executions. The communication channel can be quickly changed and notifications can easily be toggled on and off to fit your current task!
